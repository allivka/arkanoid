# arkanoid

A code for simple arkanoid client side to run from pc that camera is connected to. It also includes a configuration application to define a color to detect for camera

## Disclaimer

I did not know the project architecture when named everything as server even tough it's client in fact.
Also server just seems better from logic perspective in this case

## Dependencies

The build process for client and config app is done with CMake
